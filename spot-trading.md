## Next Steps
1. **Design and implement backend spot trading engine (order book, matching, trade execution, APIs).**
2. **Build admin UI for trading pair and market management.**
3. **Connect app UI to backend APIs for live trading, order book, and user order management.**
4. **Implement real-time updates (WebSocket) for order book and trades.**
5. **Test and secure all trading flows.**

## Implementation Roadmap & Steps

### 1. Admin: Trading Pair Management
- **Design Trading Pair Model:**
  - Fields: base asset, quote asset, status (active/paused), min/max order size, price precision, etc.
- **Backend API:**
  - CRUD endpoints for trading pairs (add, edit, remove, list, enable/disable).
- **Admin Dashboard UI:**
  - UI for managing trading pairs (form for adding/editing, list view, status toggle).
- **Integration:**
  - Ensure changes in admin UI update the backend and are reflected in the app.

### 2. Backend: Spot Trading Engine
- **Order Book Data Structure:**
  - In-memory or persistent structure for buy/sell orders per trading pair.
- **Order Entities:**
  - Model for orders (fields: user, pair, type, price, amount, status, timestamps).
- **Order Matching Engine:**
  - Logic to match buy/sell orders (market/limit), execute trades, update balances.
- **Trade History:**
  - Store executed trades for user and market history.
- **APIs:**
  - Place/cancel order, get order book depth, get recent trades, get user order/trade history.
- **Balance Locking:**
  - Lock user funds when placing orders, release/capture on execution/cancel.
- **WebSocket/Realtime:**
  - Push order book and trade updates to clients.

### 3. Admin: Market Controls & Monitoring
- **Market Status Controls:**
  - Pause/resume trading for pairs.
- **Manual Intervention:**
  - Admin tools to cancel orders, resolve disputes, or correct balances.
- **Analytics/Reports:**
  - Dashboard for trading volume, active users, etc.

### 4. App: User Trading Experience
- **Fetch Trading Pairs:**
  - Display only enabled pairs from backend.
- **Order Placement:**
  - UI for placing buy/sell (market/limit) orders, validation, error handling.
- **Order Book & Trades:**
  - Display live order book and recent trades for selected pair.
- **User Orders/History:**
  - Show open orders, order status, and trade history.
- **Realtime Updates:**
  - Subscribe to order book and trade updates via WebSocket.
- **Feedback & Edge Cases:**
  - Handle insufficient balance, order errors, and provide user feedback.

### 5. Security & Testing
- **Permissions:**
  - Ensure only admins can manage pairs/markets.
- **Validation:**
  - Validate all order and pair parameters.
- **Testing:**
  - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all trading flows.
- **Audit:**
  - Code review and security audit before launch.

## Liquidity Integration Strategy

### Overview
To provide deep liquidity and better user experience from day one, we will integrate with major third-party exchanges using the **CCXT library** for unified API access. This will allow us to bootstrap liquidity and offer competitive spreads even with low local user activity.

### Target Exchanges
- **Binance** - Largest crypto exchange, deep liquidity
- **XT Exchange** - Good for emerging markets
- **KuCoin** - Wide range of altcoins
- **Bybit** - Strong derivatives and spot trading

### Benefits
- Deep liquidity and tight spreads from launch
- Fast order execution for users
- Professional trading experience
- Reduced dependency on local user activity

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **CCXT Library Integration**
- Install CCXT: `npm install ccxt`
- Configure exchange instances with API keys
- Implement unified error handling and rate limiting

#### 2. **API Key Management**
- Secure storage of exchange API keys (encrypted)
- API key rotation and monitoring
- Separate keys for different environments (dev/staging/prod)

#### 3. **Order Routing Logic**
- **Internal First:** Try to match orders within our platform
- **External Fallback:** Route unmatched orders to external exchanges
- **Smart Routing:** Choose best exchange based on liquidity, fees, and latency

#### 4. **Order Book Aggregation**
- Fetch order books from all connected exchanges
- Merge and deduplicate orders for unified view
- Maintain real-time synchronization

#### 5. **Balance Management**
- Monitor balances across all external exchanges
- Implement automatic rebalancing
- Set up alerts for low balances

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Setup & Configuration
- [ ] **Register accounts** on all target exchanges
- [ ] **Complete KYC/verification** processes
- [ ] **Generate API keys** with trading permissions
- [ ] **Install and configure CCXT** in backend
- [ ] **Set up secure key storage** (environment variables/encrypted config)

#### Phase 2: Basic Integration
- [ ] **Implement exchange connectivity** (test connections)
- [ ] **Create order book fetching** from external exchanges
- [ ] **Build order routing logic** (internal vs external)
- [ ] **Implement basic order placement** on external exchanges

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Add smart routing** (choose best exchange per order)
- [ ] **Implement order book aggregation** and merging
- [ ] **Add real-time synchronization** (WebSocket feeds)
- [ ] **Create monitoring and alerting** systems

#### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] **Implement caching** for order books and balances
- [ ] **Add rate limiting** and error handling
- [ ] **Optimize for latency** and performance
- [ ] **Add analytics** for routing decisions

### Required Components

#### Backend Services
- **Exchange Integration Service:** Manages CCXT connections
- **Order Router:** Decides internal vs external routing
- **Balance Manager:** Tracks balances across exchanges
- **Order Book Aggregator:** Merges external order books

#### Database Entities
- **Exchange Config:** API keys, settings, status
- **External Orders:** Track orders placed on external exchanges
- **Balance Tracking:** Monitor balances across exchanges

#### Admin Controls
- **Exchange Management UI:** Configure and monitor exchanges
- **Balance Monitoring:** View balances across all exchanges
- **Routing Configuration:** Set preferences for order routing

### Considerations & Risks

#### Technical
- **Rate Limits:** Respect API rate limits for each exchange
- **Error Handling:** Handle network issues, API errors, and timeouts
- **Latency:** External API calls add latency to order execution
- **Synchronization:** Keep local and external order books in sync

#### Financial
- **Fees:** Pay trading fees on external exchanges
- **Slippage:** Price changes during order routing
- **Balance Management:** Ensure sufficient funds on all exchanges
- **Risk Management:** Set limits for external order sizes

#### Legal & Compliance
- **Terms of Service:** Comply with each exchange's ToS
- **Regulatory:** Ensure compliance with local regulations
- **Disclosure:** Be transparent about external liquidity sources

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- **API Health Checks:** Monitor exchange connectivity
- **Balance Alerts:** Notify when balances are low
- **Performance Metrics:** Track routing success rates and latency
- **Error Logging:** Comprehensive logging for debugging
