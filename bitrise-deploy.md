### Bitrise iOS Deploy — One-Step-at-a-Time Checklist

Use this list from top to bottom. Do the next unchecked item and come back.

#### 0) Confirm these basics
- [ ] You can sign in to Apple Developer / App Store Connect
- [ ] Bundle ID for this app: `com.nadiapoint.exchange`
- [ ] File exists in repo: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

#### 1) Create an App Store Connect API Key (one time)
- [x] Open App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API → Keys
- [x] Click “Generate API Key” (or +)
- [x] Name it anything (e.g., NadiaPoint CI), Role: App Manager
- [x] On the Keys list, click **Download** next to your key → save the `.p8` file
- [x] Copy the **Issuer ID** (top of the page) and the key’s **Key ID** (table column)
- [x] Keep the `.p8`, Issuer ID, and Key ID handy for the next step

Tip: If you cannot see “Integrations” or “App Store Connect API,” you must be signed in as the **Account Holder** or **Admin**. Ask the Account Holder to grant Admin, or have them create the key and send you the `.p8`, Issuer ID, and Key ID.

#### 2) Add that key in Bitrise (code signing)
- [x] In Bitrise, open your app → Project settings → Code signing → click **Set up connection**
- [x] You will land on Project settings → **Integrations → Stores → App Store Connect**
- [x] Click **Add API key** (Recommended)
- [x] Fill the form:
  - Name: `NadiaPoint CI`
  - Issuer ID: paste from App Store Connect
  - Key ID: paste from App Store Connect
  - Private key: upload the `.p8` you downloaded
  - Team: pick your Apple team (if asked)
- [x] If it redirects to Workspace settings, add the key there, then come back to this screen and select it
- [x] Return to Project settings → **Code signing** and confirm the “App Store connection” now shows your team (not “None selected”)

#### 2.5) Stop automatic builds from webhooks (optional)
- [ ] In Bitrise, click **Workflows** (top right) → **Triggers** tab
- [ ] In the workflow dropdown (top-left), switch to `primary` and repeat the same check
- [ ] In the “Build trigger map”, remove all rows for Push, Pull request, and Tag (trash/bin icon at row end)
- [ ] Ensure **Enable triggers** toggle is OFF for each workflow you use (especially `primary`)
- [ ] Click **Save changes** (top right)
- Note: The “Automatic webhook: Connected” can stay; with an empty trigger map, pushes/PRs won’t start builds. You can still start builds manually from the Builds page.

#### 3) Configure the workflow steps
- [ ] Open Bitrise → **Workflows** (top right)
- [ ] Select the default workflow (often `primary`)
- **CRITICAL**: Make sure **Git Clone Repository** step is at the very top of your workflow (this clones your code before other steps run)
- How to add a step here:
  - Click the `Flutter Install` tile once so it's selected
  - Move your mouse just below it → click the purple **+ Add step** button that appears
  - A Step Library pops up → search the step name → click **Add**
  - Repeat: hover below the last step → **+ Add step** for the next item
- [ ] Clean up old steps (if present): delete `Certificate and profile installer`, `Flutter Analyze`, `Flutter Test`, `Flutter Build`, and `Deploy to Bitrise.io - Build Artifacts` (trash/bin icon on each). Keep `Git Clone Repository` at the top.
- [ ] Add and order the steps exactly like this (top to bottom):
  1. **Git Clone Repository** (MUST be first!)
  2. Flutter Install
  3. Flutter Pub Get
  4. CocoaPods Install
  5. Manage iOS Code Signing (App Store Connect)
  6. Xcode Archive & Export for iOS
  7. Deploy to App Store Connect (TestFlight)
- [ ] In “Manage iOS Code Signing” set:
  - Apple service connection method: Default (api-key)
  - Distribution: `app-store`
  - Project path: `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
  - Scheme: `Runner`
  - Build configuration: `Release`
- [ ] Click the “Xcode Archive & Export for iOS” step and set:
  - Project path: `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
  - Scheme: `Runner`
  - Export method: `app-store`
- [ ] In “Deploy to App Store Connect” → select the same API key integration
- [ ] Save the workflow

If you cannot find "Flutter Pub Get" in the Step Library
- Add a step named **Script** right after `Flutter Install`
- Script content:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  set -ex
  flutter pub get
  ```
- **IMPORTANT**: Set the **Working Directory** to `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` (this is the project root)

 Progress (mark as you go)
- [x] Added Script step to run `flutter pub get`
- [x] Added CocoaPods Install (choose step named "Run CocoaPods install"; set Workdir to `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR/ios`, leave others default)
- [x] Added Manage iOS Code Signing and configured fields
- [x] Configured Xcode Archive & Export for iOS
- [x] Added Deploy to App Store Connect
- [ ] Saved workflow

- Notes while adding steps
- If you can’t find “iOS Auto Provision with App Store Connect”, use the newer step named “Manage iOS Code Signing” (it replaces Auto Provision). If neither shows:
  1) Click **Clear filters** and search `Code Signing`.
  2) Click the **Step bundle** tab and ensure “Bitrise Step Library (Official)” is enabled, then search again.
  3) If still nothing, continue with the next step (Xcode Archive & Export) and we’ll revisit.
- Configure Auto Provision: Connection = your API key, Distribution type = `app-store`, Bundle ID = `com.nadiapoint.exchange`.

#### 4) Start a build
- [ ] Go to Builds → click "Start build" (branch `main`) or "Rebuild" the last one

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Which workflow will be used?**

When you click "Start build", Bitrise will use the **default workflow** for your app. Here's how to confirm which one that is:

1. **Check the default workflow**:
   - Go to **Workflows** (top right) → **Triggers** tab
   - Look at the workflow dropdown (top-left) - this shows your current default
   - If it says `primary`, that's what will be used when you click "Start build"
   - If it says `deploy`, then `deploy` will be used

2. **If you want to use a specific workflow**:
   - When clicking "Start build", you can also:
     - Click the **down arrow** next to "Start build" 
     - Select your preferred workflow from the dropdown
     - Or use "Start/Schedule a Build" → select workflow manually

3. **To change the default workflow**:
   - Go to **Workflows** → **Triggers** tab
   - Use the workflow dropdown to select `primary` (or whichever you want as default)
   - Click **Save changes**

**Current recommendation**: Make sure `primary` is selected as your default workflow since that's the one we configured for iOS deployment.

#### 5) After it turns green
- [ ] Open App Store Connect → My Apps → your app → TestFlight and wait for the new build to appear (10–20 mins)

#### If the build fails (quick checks)
- [ ] **Git Clone Repository missing**: If you see "Expected to find project root in current working directory" and the directory is empty, you're missing the **Git Clone Repository** step at the very top of your workflow
- [ ] **CocoaPods issues**: If you see "The Podfile does not contain any dependencies" or "Could not automatically select an Xcode workspace":
  1. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure it has dependencies and workspace specification
  2. **Add workspace to Podfile**: Add this line to your `ios/Podfile`:
     ```ruby
     workspace 'Runner.xcworkspace'
     ```
  3. **Alternative**: Skip CocoaPods step if your Flutter project doesn't use native iOS dependencies
  4. **Quick fix**: **Remove the "Run CocoaPods install" step** from your workflow - it's not essential for basic Flutter iOS builds
- [ ] **CocoaPods podhelper.rb error**: If you see "cannot load such file -- ../.ios/Flutter/podhelper.rb":
  1. **CRITICAL**: Make sure the **Script step** (running `flutter pub get`) runs BEFORE the CocoaPods step
  2. **Check Script step working directory**: Ensure it's set to `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` (project root)
  3. **Alternative script content**: If still failing, try this script content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     set -ex
     cd $BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR
     flutter clean
     flutter pub get
     # Generate iOS files properly
     flutter build ios --no-codesign --debug
     ```
  4. **Remove CocoaPods step**: If the issue persists, **remove the "Run CocoaPods install" step** entirely - Flutter handles iOS dependencies automatically
- [ ] Signing error: make sure the Auto Provision step is before Xcode Archive and uses the correct Bundle ID + API key
- [ ] Workspace/scheme error: ensure `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` and `Runner` are set in the Xcode Archive step
- [ ] CocoaPods error: ensure "CocoaPods Install" step exists and is before Xcode Archive
- [ ] **Script step directory error**: If you see "Expected to find project root in current working directory", try these solutions:
  1. **First, check if Git Clone Repository step exists**: This step MUST be at the very top of your workflow
  2. **Check if Flutter is properly installed**: The Script step should run after Flutter Install step
  3. **Verify working directory**: Make sure Script step has `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` as Working Directory
  4. **Alternative script content**: If still failing, try this script content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     set -ex
     cd $BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR
     pwd
     ls -la
     flutter --version
     flutter pub get
     ```
  5. **Check Flutter Install step**: Make sure Flutter Install step completed successfully (green checkmark)
- [ ] To see details: open the failed build → Logs → scroll to the first red error
- [ ] **Manage iOS Code Signing error**: If you see "CertificateURLList: required variable is not present":
  1. **Check Apple service connection method**: Make sure it's set to "Default (api-key)"
  2. **Select your API key**: In the "Apple service connection method" dropdown, select your "NadiaPoint CI" API key (not "Default (api-key)")
  3. **If API key doesn't appear in dropdown** (even though it's configured):
     - **Try selecting "api-key"** (without "Default") from the dropdown - this should use your configured API key
     - **Alternative**: Try selecting "Default (api-key)" - this should also work if your API key is properly configured
  4. **If still failing with API key method**:
     - **Remove the "Manage iOS Code Signing" step entirely** - it's not essential for basic Flutter iOS builds
     - **Let Xcode Archive step handle code signing automatically** - it will use your API key configuration
  5. **Verify settings**: Ensure these fields are set:
     - Apple service connection method: "api-key" or "Default (api-key)"
     - Distribution method: `app-store`
     - Project path: `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
     - Scheme: `Runner`
     - Build configuration: `Release`
