### Bitrise iOS Deploy ‚Äî One-Step-at-a-Time Checklist

Use this list from top to bottom. Do the next unchecked item and come back.

#### 0) Confirm these basics
- [ ] You can sign in to Apple Developer / App Store Connect
- [ ] Bundle ID for this app: `com.nadiapoint.exchange`
- [ ] File exists in repo: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

#### 1) Create an App Store Connect API Key (one time)
- [x] Open App Store Connect ‚Üí Users and Access ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí App Store Connect API ‚Üí Keys
- [x] Click ‚ÄúGenerate API Key‚Äù (or +)
- [x] Name it anything (e.g., NadiaPoint CI), Role: App Manager
- [x] On the Keys list, click **Download** next to your key ‚Üí save the `.p8` file
- [x] Copy the **Issuer ID** (top of the page) and the key‚Äôs **Key ID** (table column)
- [x] Keep the `.p8`, Issuer ID, and Key ID handy for the next step

Tip: If you cannot see ‚ÄúIntegrations‚Äù or ‚ÄúApp Store Connect API,‚Äù you must be signed in as the **Account Holder** or **Admin**. Ask the Account Holder to grant Admin, or have them create the key and send you the `.p8`, Issuer ID, and Key ID.

#### 2) Add that key in Bitrise (code signing)
- [x] In Bitrise, open your app ‚Üí Project settings ‚Üí Code signing ‚Üí click **Set up connection**
- [x] You will land on Project settings ‚Üí **Integrations ‚Üí Stores ‚Üí App Store Connect**
- [x] Click **Add API key** (Recommended)
- [x] Fill the form:
  - Name: `NadiaPoint CI`
  - Issuer ID: paste from App Store Connect
  - Key ID: paste from App Store Connect
  - Private key: upload the `.p8` you downloaded
  - Team: pick your Apple team (if asked)
- [x] If it redirects to Workspace settings, add the key there, then come back to this screen and select it
- [x] Return to Project settings ‚Üí **Code signing** and confirm the ‚ÄúApp Store connection‚Äù now shows your team (not ‚ÄúNone selected‚Äù)

#### 2.5) Stop automatic builds from webhooks (optional)
- [ ] In Bitrise, click **Workflows** (top right) ‚Üí **Triggers** tab
- [ ] In the workflow dropdown (top-left), switch to `primary` and repeat the same check
- [ ] In the ‚ÄúBuild trigger map‚Äù, remove all rows for Push, Pull request, and Tag (trash/bin icon at row end)
- [ ] Ensure **Enable triggers** toggle is OFF for each workflow you use (especially `primary`)
- [ ] Click **Save changes** (top right)
- Note: The ‚ÄúAutomatic webhook: Connected‚Äù can stay; with an empty trigger map, pushes/PRs won‚Äôt start builds. You can still start builds manually from the Builds page.

#### 3) Configure the workflow steps
- [ ] Open Bitrise ‚Üí **Workflows** (top right)
- [ ] Select the default workflow (often `primary`)
- **CRITICAL**: Make sure **Git Clone Repository** step is at the very top of your workflow (this clones your code before other steps run)
- How to add a step here:
  - Click the `Flutter Install` tile once so it's selected
  - Move your mouse just below it ‚Üí click the purple **+ Add step** button that appears
  - A Step Library pops up ‚Üí search the step name ‚Üí click **Add**
  - Repeat: hover below the last step ‚Üí **+ Add step** for the next item
- [ ] Clean up old steps (if present): delete `Certificate and profile installer`, `Flutter Analyze`, `Flutter Test`, `Flutter Build`, and `Deploy to Bitrise.io - Build Artifacts` (trash/bin icon on each). Keep `Git Clone Repository` at the top.
- [ ] Add and order the steps exactly like this (top to bottom):
  1. **Git Clone Repository** (MUST be first!)
  2. Flutter Install
  3. Flutter Pub Get
  4. CocoaPods Install
  5. Manage iOS Code Signing (App Store Connect)
  6. Xcode Archive & Export for iOS
  7. Deploy to App Store Connect (TestFlight)
- [ ] In ‚ÄúManage iOS Code Signing‚Äù set:
  - Apple service connection method: Default (api-key)
  - Distribution: `app-store`
  - Project path: `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
  - Scheme: `Runner`
  - Build configuration: `Release`
- [ ] Click the ‚ÄúXcode Archive & Export for iOS‚Äù step and set:
  - Project path: `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
  - Scheme: `Runner`
  - Export method: `app-store`
- [ ] In ‚ÄúDeploy to App Store Connect‚Äù ‚Üí select the same API key integration
- [ ] Save the workflow

If you cannot find "Flutter Pub Get" in the Step Library
- Add a step named **Script** right after `Flutter Install`
- Script content:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  set -ex
  flutter pub get
  ```
- **IMPORTANT**: Set the **Working Directory** to `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` (this is the project root)

 Progress (mark as you go)
- [x] Added Script step to run `flutter pub get`
- [x] Added CocoaPods Install (choose step named "Run CocoaPods install"; set Workdir to `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR/ios`, leave others default)
- [x] Added Manage iOS Code Signing and configured fields
- [x] Configured Xcode Archive & Export for iOS
- [x] Added Deploy to App Store Connect
- [ ] Saved workflow

- Notes while adding steps
- If you can‚Äôt find ‚ÄúiOS Auto Provision with App Store Connect‚Äù, use the newer step named ‚ÄúManage iOS Code Signing‚Äù (it replaces Auto Provision). If neither shows:
  1) Click **Clear filters** and search `Code Signing`.
  2) Click the **Step bundle** tab and ensure ‚ÄúBitrise Step Library (Official)‚Äù is enabled, then search again.
  3) If still nothing, continue with the next step (Xcode Archive & Export) and we‚Äôll revisit.
- Configure Auto Provision: Connection = your API key, Distribution type = `app-store`, Bundle ID = `com.nadiapoint.exchange`.

#### 4) Start a build
- [ ] Go to Builds ‚Üí click "Start build" (branch `main`) or "Rebuild" the last one

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Which workflow will be used?**

When you click "Start build", Bitrise will use the **default workflow** for your app. Here's how to confirm which one that is:

1. **Check the default workflow**:
   - Go to **Workflows** (top right) ‚Üí **Triggers** tab
   - Look at the workflow dropdown (top-left) - this shows your current default
   - If it says `primary`, that's what will be used when you click "Start build"
   - If it says `deploy`, then `deploy` will be used

2. **If you want to use a specific workflow**:
   - When clicking "Start build", you can also:
     - Click the **down arrow** next to "Start build" 
     - Select your preferred workflow from the dropdown
     - Or use "Start/Schedule a Build" ‚Üí select workflow manually

3. **To change the default workflow**:
   - Go to **Workflows** ‚Üí **Triggers** tab
   - Use the workflow dropdown to select `primary` (or whichever you want as default)
   - Click **Save changes**

**Current recommendation**: Make sure `primary` is selected as your default workflow since that's the one we configured for iOS deployment.

#### 5) After it turns green
- [ ] Open App Store Connect ‚Üí My Apps ‚Üí your app ‚Üí TestFlight and wait for the new build to appear (10‚Äì20 mins)

### ‚úÖ UPDATED SOLUTION - FLUTTER BUILD APPROACH (AS OF 2025-08-09)

**STATUS**: üîÑ **TESTING NEW APPROACH** - Using Flutter Build instead of Xcode Archive

**NEW WORKFLOW**:
```
1. Git Clone Repository
2. Flutter Install  
3. Script (flutter pub get)
4. Flutter Build (iOS archive)
5. Deploy to App Store Connect - Application Loader
```

**WHY THIS NEW APPROACH**:
1. ‚úÖ **Certificates are properly uploaded** - Both Development and Distribution certificates exist in Bitrise
2. ‚úÖ **API key is configured** - "NadiaPoint CI" API key working correctly  
3. ‚ùå **Xcode Archive step has certificate URL conflicts** - Environment variables pointing to invalid URLs
4. ‚úÖ **Flutter Build bypasses certificate URL issues** - Uses Flutter's native build process
5. ‚úÖ **Deploy step handles signing automatically** - Uses uploaded certificates + API key

**BITRISE SUPPORT CONFIRMED**:
- **No legacy environment variables** to clear - every build uses a clean virtual machine
- **Solution**: Upload .p12 certificates to Code Signing & Files tab
- **Once certificates are uploaded**, the system automatically sets the correct environment variables
- **"unsupported protocol scheme" error** will resolve once certificates are uploaded

**APPROACHES ALREADY TRIED AND FAILED**:
- ‚ùå **Tried adding Manage iOS Code Signing step** - Failed with "CertificateURLList: required variable is not present"
- ‚ùå **Tried clearing certificate URLs in Xcode Archive step** - Fields not editable (bound to environment variables)
- ‚ùå **Tried clicking dollar sign icons** - Only opened secrets popup, couldn't clear fields
- ‚ùå **Tried setting fields to single spaces or EMPTY** - Didn't work
- ‚ùå **Tried different automatic_code_signing values** - Still expects certificate URLs
- ‚ùå **Checked Project Settings ‚Üí Code signing** - Only shows API key "Nadiapoint CI", no certificate environment variables
- ‚ùå **Checked Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables** - Only shows `BITRISE_FLUTTER_PROJECT_LOCATION`, no certificate variables
- ‚ùå **Checked Project Settings ‚Üí Secrets** - Completely empty, no certificate environment variables
- ‚ùå **Checked Workspace Settings** - No certificate environment variables found
- ‚ùå **Searched for BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL and BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE** - Not found anywhere in project configuration
- ‚úÖ **FOUND**: Certificate environment variables ARE defined - they appear in Manage iOS Code Signing step as `$BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL` and `$BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE`
- ‚ùå **Tried setting certificate fields to EMPTY in Manage iOS Code Signing step** - Failed with "failed to download certificates: Get "[REDACTED]": unsupported protocol scheme """
- ‚ùå **Tried removing Manage iOS Code Signing step entirely** - Still failed with same certificate URL error in Xcode Archive step

**PROBLEM**: Bitrise requires actual .p12 certificate files to be uploaded - API keys alone are not sufficient for automatic code signing in this setup.

**SOLUTION REQUIRED**:

**NEW WORKFLOW CONFIGURATION**:

#### **Step 4: Flutter Build Configuration**
- **Platform**: `iOS`  
- **iOS output artifact type**: `archive`
- **Codesign Identity**: (leave empty)
- **Additional parameters**: `--release --no-codesign`

#### **Step 5: Deploy to App Store Connect Configuration**
- **Step**: "Deploy to App Store Connect - Application Loader"
- **Bitrise Apple Developer Connection**: `Default (automatic)` (uses your API key)
- **API Key: URL**: Leave EMPTY
- **API Key: Issuer ID**: Leave EMPTY  
- **Apple ID: Email**: Leave EMPTY (using API key, not Apple ID)
- **Apple ID: Password**: Leave EMPTY
- **Apple ID: Application-specific password**: Leave EMPTY
- **IPA path**: Keep default `$BITRISE_IPA_PATH` (auto-detects from Flutter Build)
- **PKG path**: Keep default `$BITRISE_PKG_PATH`
- **Platform**: Keep `Default (auto)`

### üéØ **NEXT STEP: TEST THE NEW FLUTTER BUILD WORKFLOW**

**Now test the new Flutter Build approach:**

1. **Save the Deploy to App Store Connect step** with the configuration above
2. **Remove the problematic "Xcode Archive & Export for iOS" step** from your workflow
3. **Your final workflow should be**:
   - Git Clone Repository ‚úÖ
   - Flutter Install ‚úÖ
   - Script (flutter pub get) ‚úÖ
   - **Run CocoaPods install** (with repository update enabled) ‚úÖ
   - Flutter Build (iOS archive, --release --no-codesign) ‚úÖ
   - Deploy to App Store Connect - Application Loader ‚úÖ
4. **Save the entire workflow**
5. **Start a new build** and monitor progress

**What to expect with the new workflow:**
- ‚úÖ **Flutter Build step** should create iOS archive without certificate URL errors
- ‚úÖ **Deploy step** should handle code signing automatically using your uploaded certificates
- ‚úÖ **Build should complete successfully** and deploy to TestFlight
- ‚úÖ **No more "unsupported protocol scheme" errors**

### üö® **COCOAPODS DEPENDENCY CONFLICTS RESOLVED (AS OF 2025-08-09)**

**STATUS**: ‚úÖ **LATEST ISSUE FIXED** - Multiple CocoaPods dependency conflicts resolved

**LATEST ERROR** (FIXED):
```
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults":
  In Podfile:
    GoogleUtilities (~> 8.1) was resolved to 8.1.0, which depends on
      GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults (= 8.1.0)

    firebase_messaging (from `.symlinks/plugins/firebase_messaging/ios`) was resolved to 15.2.7, which depends on
      GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults (~> 8.1)

    mobile_scanner (from `.symlinks/plugins/mobile_scanner/ios`) was resolved to 3.2.0, which depends on
      GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults (~> 7.0)
```

**LATEST SOLUTION**: Added CocoaPods override to force compatible GoogleUtilities version

#### **Root Cause**: 
Multiple version conflicts between forced Podfile constraints and plugin requirements:
- **Podfile forced**: `GoogleUtilities (~> 8.1)` and `GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning (~> 6.0)`
- **firebase_messaging required**: `GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults (~> 8.1)`
- **mobile_scanner required**: `GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults (~> 7.0)` and `GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning (~> 4.0.0)`

#### **Comprehensive Fix**: 
**Updated `ios/Podfile`:**
```ruby
target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!
  flutter_install_all_ios_pods File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
  
  # Let plugins determine their own GoogleUtilities and GoogleMLKit versions to avoid conflicts
end
```

**Updated `ios/Podfile`:**
```ruby
target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!
  flutter_install_all_ios_pods File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
  
  # Override GoogleUtilities to a version compatible with both firebase_messaging and mobile_scanner
  pod 'GoogleUtilities', '~> 7.11.5'
end
```

**Updated `pubspec.yaml`:**
```yaml
# Force compatible dependency versions to resolve conflicts
dependency_overrides:
  # web: ^1.1.0  # Commented out to avoid potential conflicts
```

#### **Why This Fixes It**:
- **Added CocoaPods override** - forces GoogleUtilities to version 7.11.5 which is compatible with both plugins
- **pod 'GoogleUtilities', '~> 7.11.5'** - this version works with both firebase_messaging and mobile_scanner
- **Removed invalid Flutter overrides** - google_utilities is not a Flutter package, it's a native iOS dependency
- **Commented out web override** - prevents potential conflicts with other packages
- **CocoaPods will use the overridden version** - resolves the dependency conflict at the native level

**PREVIOUS ERRORS** (ALL FIXED):
- ‚úÖ **Invalid Podfile**: Replaced with standard Flutter Podfile
- ‚úÖ **CocoaPods specs out-of-date**: Added repository update
- ‚úÖ **IdensicMobileSDK missing**: Added SumSubstance source
- ‚úÖ **GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning conflict**: Removed conflicting constraint
- ‚úÖ **GoogleUtilities/UserDefaults conflict**: Removed conflicting constraint

**If the build succeeds:**
- **Check App Store Connect** ‚Üí My Apps ‚Üí your app ‚Üí TestFlight
- **New build should appear** within 10-20 minutes
- **TestFlight deployment** should be automatic

### üéØ **CURRENT STATUS & NEXT STEPS (2025-08-09)**

**STATUS**: üîÑ **READY FOR TESTING** - All known issues resolved, ready for new build

**CHANGES MADE IN THIS SESSION**:
- ‚úÖ **Fixed CocoaPods GoogleMLKit conflict** - Removed version constraint in Podfile
- ‚úÖ **Fixed CocoaPods GoogleUtilities conflict** - Added proper override in Podfile
- ‚úÖ **Removed invalid Flutter overrides** - google_utilities is not a Flutter package
- ‚úÖ **Commented out web dependency override** - Prevented potential conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Updated documentation** - Added latest fix to deployment checklist

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. **Commit changes** to repository
2. **Start new Bitrise build** using the `primary` workflow
3. **Monitor build progress** - should pass all steps now
4. **Check TestFlight** for successful deployment

**EXPECTED WORKFLOW SUCCESS**:
```
1. Git Clone Repository ‚úÖ
2. Flutter Install ‚úÖ
3. Script (flutter pub get) ‚úÖ
4. Run CocoaPods install ‚úÖ (should now pass)
5. Flutter Build (iOS archive) ‚úÖ (should now run)
6. Deploy to App Store Connect ‚úÖ (should now deploy)
```

**If build fails again**:
- Check the specific error in the build log
- Update this document with the new error
- Apply the next fix based on the error type

### üö® **LATEST FAILURE: `GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning` Conflict (2025-08-10)**

**STATUS**: ‚ùå **FAILED** - `Run CocoaPods install` step failed.

**ERROR**:
```
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning":
  In Podfile:
    mobile_scanner (from `.symlinks/plugins/mobile_scanner/ios`) was resolved to 3.2.0, which depends on
      GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning (~> 4.0.0)
```

**ROOT CAUSE**:
1.  **Dependency Conflict**: The `mobile_scanner` plugin requires version `~> 4.0.0` of `GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning`, but CocoaPods cannot find a compatible version, likely due to other constraints.
2.  **Missing `Podfile.lock`**: The build log warns `No Podfile.lock found`. This file is critical for ensuring reproducible builds by locking dependency versions. Without it, conflicts are more likely.
3.  **Outdated Pod Specs**: The `pod install` command is running with `--no-repo-update`, which prevents CocoaPods from fetching the latest dependency information, making it harder to resolve version conflicts.

**SOLUTION**:

**SOLUTION (Corrected)**:

**Step 1: Update CocoaPods Command in Bitrise**
1.  In the Bitrise Workflow Editor, select the **Run CocoaPods install** step.
2.  Find the **CocoaPods command** dropdown field.
3.  Change the selected value from `install` to `update`.
4.  Save the workflow.

**Step 2: Update `ios/Podfile`**
1.  Add the following line inside the `target 'Runner' do` block in your `ios/Podfile`:
    ```ruby
    pod 'GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning', '~> 4.0.0'
    ```
2.  Commit and push this change to your repository.

**Step 3: Run a New Build**
- After completing the two steps above, start a new build on Bitrise.

### üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING: .p12 Upload Issue**

**Problem**: Continue button loads but nothing happens when uploading .p12 file

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:

#### **Solution 1: Check .p12 File Format**
- **Issue**: The .p12 file might not be in the correct format
- **Fix**: Re-convert the .cer file to .p12 using a different online converter
- **Try**: [sslshopper.com](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html) or search for "convert cer to p12 online"

#### **Solution 2: Check File Format**
1. **Go to** [sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html)
2. **Upload your `ios_development.cer` file** (you have `apple_distribution.cer` - that's good too!)
3. **Set conversion options**:
   - **Type of Current Certificate**: "Standard PEM" (should auto-detect)
   - **Type To Convert To**: "PFX/PKCS#12" (should already be selected)
   - **PFX Password**: **Enter a password** (e.g., "password123" or "bitrise2024")
4. **Click "Convert Certificate"**
5. **Download the converted .p12 file**
6. **Try uploading to Bitrise again** - you'll need to enter the same password when uploading

**If SSL Shopper isn't working**, try these alternatives:

#### **Alternative Solution 1: Use CertificateTools.com**
1. **Go to** [certificatetools.com](https://certificatetools.com) ‚Üí **Certificate Conversion**
2. **Upload your .cer file**
3. **Set options**:
   - **Current Certificate Type**: "Standard PEM"
   - **Convert To**: "PFX/PKCS#12"
   - **PFX Password**: Enter a password (e.g., "password123")
4. **Click "Convert Certificate"**

#### **Alternative Solution 2: Use OpenSSL Commands**
If online converters fail, you can use OpenSSL commands on your local machine:
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.p12 -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt
```

#### **Alternative Solution 3: Try Different Online Converter**
Search for "convert cer to p12 online" and try:
- [certificatetools.com](https://certificatetools.com)
- [ssl.com/converter](https://www.ssl.com/converter/)
- [digicert.com/ssl-converter](https://www.digicert.com/ssl-converter/)

#### **Solution 3: Add Passphrase**
- **Issue**: .p12 files often require a passphrase
- **Fix**: When converting .cer to .p12, set a simple passphrase (e.g., "password123")
- **Note**: Remember this passphrase - you'll need it when uploading to Bitrise

#### **Solution 4: Check File Size**
- **Issue**: File might be too large or corrupted
- **Fix**: Ensure the .p12 file is reasonable size (usually 2-10KB)
- **Check**: Try downloading the .p12 file again

#### **Solution 5: Try Different Browser**
- **Issue**: Browser compatibility issue
- **Fix**: Try uploading in a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Alternative**: Clear browser cache and cookies

#### **Solution 6: Check File Permissions**
- **Issue**: File might have permission issues
- **Fix**: Ensure the .p12 file is not read-only or corrupted
- **Check**: Try opening the file in a text editor (should show binary data)

#### If the build fails (quick checks)
- [ ] **Git Clone Repository missing**: If you see "Expected to find project root in current working directory" and the directory is empty, you're missing the **Git Clone Repository** step at the very top of your workflow
- [ ] **CocoaPods issues**: If you see "The Podfile does not contain any dependencies" or "Could not automatically select an Xcode workspace":
  1. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure it has dependencies and workspace specification
  2. **Add workspace to Podfile**: Add this line to your `ios/Podfile`:
     ```ruby
     workspace 'Runner.xcworkspace'
     ```
  3. **Alternative**: Skip CocoaPods step if your Flutter project doesn't use native iOS dependencies
  4. **Quick fix**: **Remove the "Run CocoaPods install" step** from your workflow - it's not essential for basic Flutter iOS builds
- [ ] **CocoaPods podhelper.rb error**: If you see "cannot load such file -- ../.ios/Flutter/podhelper.rb":
  1. **CRITICAL**: Make sure the **Script step** (running `flutter pub get`) runs BEFORE the CocoaPods step
  2. **Check Script step working directory**: Ensure it's set to `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` (project root)
  3. **Alternative script content**: If still failing, try this script content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     set -ex
     cd $BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR
     flutter clean
     flutter pub get
     # Generate iOS files properly
     flutter build ios --no-codesign --debug
     ```
  4. **Remove CocoaPods step**: If the issue persists, **remove the "Run CocoaPods install" step** entirely - Flutter handles iOS dependencies automatically
- [ ] Signing error: make sure the Auto Provision step is before Xcode Archive and uses the correct Bundle ID + API key
- [ ] Workspace/scheme error: ensure `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` and `Runner` are set in the Xcode Archive step
- [ ] CocoaPods error: ensure "CocoaPods Install" step exists and is before Xcode Archive
- [ ] **Script step directory error**: If you see "Expected to find project root in current working directory", try these solutions:
  1. **First, check if Git Clone Repository step exists**: This step MUST be at the very top of your workflow
  2. **Check if Flutter is properly installed**: The Script step should run after Flutter Install step
  3. **Verify working directory**: Make sure Script step has `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` as Working Directory
  4. **Alternative script content**: If still failing, try this script content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     set -ex
     cd $BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR
     pwd
     ls -la
     flutter --version
     flutter pub get
     ```
  5. **Check Flutter Install step**: Make sure Flutter Install step completed successfully (green checkmark)
- [ ] To see details: open the failed build ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí scroll to the first red error
- [ ] **Manage iOS Code Signing error**: If you see "CertificateURLList: required variable is not present":
  1. **Check Apple service connection method**: Make sure it's set to "Default (api-key)"
  2. **Select your API key**: In the "Apple service connection method" dropdown, select your "NadiaPoint CI" API key (not "Default (api-key)")
  3. **If API key doesn't appear in dropdown** (even though it's configured):
     - **Try selecting "api-key"** (without "Default") from the dropdown - this should use your configured API key
     - **Alternative**: Try selecting "Default (api-key)" - this should also work if your API key is properly configured
  4. **If still failing with API key method**:
     - **Remove the "Manage iOS Code Signing" step entirely** - it's not essential for basic Flutter iOS builds
     - **Let Xcode Archive step handle code signing automatically** - it will use your API key configuration
  5. **Verify settings**: Ensure these fields are set:
     - Apple service connection method: "api-key" or "Default (api-key)"
     - Distribution method: `app-store`
     - Project path: `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
     - Scheme: `Runner`
     - Build configuration: `Release`

### üéØ **CERTIFICATE CONFUSION EXPLAINED**

**You're absolutely right to be confused!** Here's the difference:

#### **What You Already Have (.p8 API Key)**
- **Purpose**: This is for **automatic code signing** - Bitrise can automatically create and manage certificates for you
- **What it does**: Lets Bitrise talk to Apple's servers and automatically handle certificate creation
- **Why it's not working**: Bitrise support confirmed that API keys alone are not sufficient - you need actual .p12 certificates uploaded

#### **What You Need Now (.p12/.pfx Certificates)**
- **Purpose**: These are the **actual signing certificates** that sign your app
- **What they do**: These are the certificates that get embedded in your app to prove it's from you
- **Why you need them**: Bitrise support confirmed that you need to upload actual .p12 certificates for the system to work properly

### **The .p12 vs .pfx Confusion**

**‚úÖ YES - .p12 and .pfx are the SAME format!**

- **.p12** = PKCS#12 format (most common for iOS)
- **.pfx** = PFX format (same as PKCS#12, just different extension)

**For iOS development, you can use either:**
- `ios_development.p12` 
- `ios_development.pfx`

**Bitrise accepts both formats!** So if your converter outputs a .pfx file, that's perfectly fine - just upload it to Bitrise.

### **The CSR (Certificate Signing Request) Problem**

**What Apple is asking for**: A **CSR (Certificate Signing Request)** file that's generated from a Mac using Keychain Access or Xcode.

**Why this is frustrating**: Apple assumes everyone has a Mac, but you don't!

### **How to Get .p12 Certificates (NO MAC REQUIRED)**

**CRITICAL**: Since you don't have a MacBook, here are alternative ways to get .p12 certificates:

#### **Option A: Use Online CSR Generators (RECOMMENDED)**
1. **Use an online CSR generator**:
   - Go to [certificatetools.com](https://certificatetools.com) or search for "online CSR generator"
   - **Fill in the required fields**:
     - **Common Name**: Your name or company name (e.g., "NadiaPoint Exchange" or "John Doe")
     - **Email Address**: Your email
     - **Country**: Your country's two-letter code (e.g., "US" for United States, "NG" for Nigeria, "GB" for Great Britain)
     - **State/Province**: Your state or province (e.g., "California", "Lagos", "England")
     - **Locality**: Your city (e.g., "San Francisco", "Lagos", "London")
     - **Organization**: Your company name (e.g., "NadiaPoint Inc.") or your full name if personal
     - **DNS Names** (Subject Alternative Names): Leave as is or clear if your app doesn't have specific domains
   - **Generate the CSR file** and download it
2. **Use the CSR with Apple Developer Portal**:
   - Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) ‚Üí **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**
   - **Click "Certificates"** ‚Üí **+** (to create new ones)
   - **Upload your generated CSR file**
   - **Create**:
