### **Part 1: Wisdom Creates a Certificate Request**

**Miracle**: "Wisdom, please start sharing your screen so I can guide you."

**Wisdom**: 
1.  Click the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of your screen.
2.  Type `Keychain Access` and press `Enter`.

**Miracle**: "Great. Now we need to find the Certificate Assistant. Let's try a few different ways since it can be in different places depending on your macOS version."

**Method 1 - Top Menu Bar:**
**Miracle**: "Look at the very top menu bar of your screen (where it says Keychain Access, File, Edit, View, etc.). Click on `Keychain Access` in that top menu bar and look for `Certificate Assistant` or `Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...`"

**If Method 1 doesn't work, try Method 2:**

**Method 2 - Keyboard Shortcut:**
**Miracle**: "Press `Command + Option + A` on your keyboard. This should open the Certificate Assistant directly."

**If Method 2 doesn't work, try Method 3:**

**Method 3 - For macOS Sequoia (15.6) and newer:**
**Miracle**: "Close the 'About This Mac' window. In Keychain Access, click on `File` in the top menu bar and look for `New` then `Certificate Request` or similar."

**Method 4 - Terminal Approach (if all else fails):**
**Miracle**: "Close Keychain Access completely. Click the magnifying glass, type `Terminal` and press Enter. Then follow these steps:"

1. **Miracle**: "First, if there's any command running, press `Control + C` to clear it."
2. **Miracle**: "Type: `openssl genrsa -out ~/Desktop/private.key 2048` and press Enter."
3. **Miracle**: "Then type: `openssl req -new -key ~/Desktop/private.key -out ~/Desktop/CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest -subj '/CN=Goddey Ojabuoma/emailAddress=maihiben@gmail.com'`"
4. **Miracle**: "This will create both the private key and certificate request files on the Desktop."
5. **Miracle**: "Check the Desktop for a file called `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest` and send it to me."

**Once you find the Certificate Assistant:**
**Wisdom**: A new window should appear with certificate request options. 

**Miracle**:
1.  "In the `User Email Address` field, I'll give you my Apple Developer email. Please type it in."
2.  "In the `Common Name` field, please type `Goddey Ojabuoma`."
3.  "Leave the `CA Email` field blank."
4.  "Now, click the little circle that says `Saved to disk`."
5.  "Click `Continue`."

**Wisdom**:
1.  A save window will pop up. Save the file to your Desktop. It should be named `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest`.
2.  Click `Save`.

**Miracle**: "Perfect. Now, please find that file on your Desktop and send it to me through our chat or email."

**Wisdom**: Send the file to Miracle.

### **Part 2: Miracle Creates the Official Certificate**

**Miracle**: "Thanks, Wisdom. I have the file. Now I need to do a few things on my end. It will just take a minute."

**Miracle (Your Steps)**:
1.  Go to the Apple Developer website (`developer.apple.com`) and log in.
2.  Go to `Certificates, IDs & Profiles`.
3.  Click the `+` button to add a new certificate.
4.  Select `Apple Distribution` and click `Continue`.
5.  When it asks you to upload a signing request, click `Choose File` and upload the `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest` file that Wisdom just sent you.
6.  Click `Continue` and then `Download` to get the official certificate. It will be named `distribution.cer`.

**Miracle**: "Okay, Wisdom. I've created the certificate. I'm sending it to you now. It's called `apple_distribution.cer` (or `distribution.cer`)."

### **Part 3: Wisdom Creates the Final .p12 File**

**Miracle**: "Okay Wisdom, I'm sending you the `apple_distribution.cer` file. Before you open it, we need to import the private key we created on the Desktop. This is a crucial step."

**Wisdom**:
1.  Save the `apple_distribution.cer` file from Miracle onto your Desktop.
2.  Find the **`private.key`** file that is also on your Desktop.
3.  Drag the `private.key` file from your Desktop and drop it directly onto the list of items in the main Keychain Access window (the large white area).
4.  If it asks for a password, enter your Mac's login password.

**Miracle**: "**What if dragging it gives an error like 'Unable to import'?** No problem, we'll use the Terminal. Please open the Terminal app."

**Miracle**: "Once it's open, copy and paste this exact command into the Terminal and press Enter:"

```bash
security import ~/Desktop/private.key -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
```

**Miracle**: "It will probably ask for your Mac login password. Type it in and press Enter. The cursor won't move, but it's working."

**Miracle**: "Great, the key is imported. NOW, please find and double-click the `apple_distribution.cer` file on your Desktop."

**Wisdom**: Double-click the `.cer` file.

**Miracle**: "Perfect. Now, in the Keychain Access window, click on `My Certificates` in the left sidebar."

**Wisdom**: Click on `My Certificates` in the left sidebar.

**Miracle**: "Great! Now look in the main area for a certificate that says `Apple Distribution: Goddey Ojabuoma (J3RMZWZ73D)`."

**Miracle**: "This next part is the most important check. Do you see a little arrow to the left of that certificate name? Please click it."

**Miracle**: "**Wait! What if there's no arrow?** That means we missed a step. Please find the `Apple Distribution` certificate in the list, right-click it, and choose `Delete`. Then we must start Part 3 over again, making sure to drag the `private.key` file in *before* double-clicking the certificate file."

**Wisdom**: Click the arrow. A "private key" should appear nested underneath the certificate.

**Miracle**: "Perfect! Seeing that private key means everything is working. Now we'll export the final file."

**Wisdom**:
1.  Click on the `Apple Distribution...` certificate line to highlight it.
2.  Hold down the `Command` (âŒ˜) key and click on the private key underneath it. (Both lines should now be selected).
3.  Right-click on either of the selected lines and choose `Export 2 items...`.

**Miracle**: "A save window will appear. Please name the file `Nadiapoint_Distribution.p12` and make sure the `File Format` at the bottom says `.p12`. Save it to your Desktop."

**Wisdom**: Save the file.

**Miracle**: "It's going to ask for a password. I'll give you one to type in. You'll have to enter it twice. This is the password for the file itself."

**Wisdom**: Enter the password Miracle provides. It may then ask for your Mac's login password to approve the export. Enter your own Mac password if it asks.

**Miracle**: "That's it! Please send me that final `Nadiapoint_Distribution.p12` file from your Desktop."

**Wisdom**: Send the final `.p12` file to Miracle.

**Miracle**: "Thank you so much, Wisdom! That's everything I need. You can delete all the files from your Desktop now."
