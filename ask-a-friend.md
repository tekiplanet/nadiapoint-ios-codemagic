### **Part 3: Wisdom Creates the Final .p12 File**

**Wisdom**:
1.  Save the `distribution.cer` file from Miracle onto your Desktop.
2.  Find the file and double-click it. Keychain Access will open and install it. It might seem like nothing happened, but it's done.

**Miracle**: "Okay, now let's check if it installed correctly. Go back to the Keychain Access app."

**Wisdom**:
1.  In the `My Certificates` category, look for `Apple Distribution: Goddey Ojabuoma (J3RMZWZ73D)`.

**Miracle**: "This next part is the most important check. Do you see a little arrow to the left of that certificate name? Please click it."

**Wisdom**: Click the arrow. A "private key" should appear nested underneath the certificate.

**Miracle**: "Perfect! Seeing that private key means everything is working. Now we'll export the final file."

**Wisdom**:
1.  Click on the `Apple Distribution...` certificate line to highlight it.
2.  Hold down the `Command` (âŒ˜) key and click on the private key underneath it. (Both lines should now be selected).
3.  Right-click on either of the selected lines and choose `Export 2 items...`.

**Miracle**: "A save window will appear. Please name the file `Nadiapoint_Distribution.p12` and make sure the `File Format` at the bottom says `.p12`. Save it to your Desktop."

**Wisdom**: Save the file.

**Miracle**: "It's going to ask for a password. I'll give you one to type in. You'll have to enter it twice. This is the password for the file itself."

**Wisdom**: Enter the password Miracle provides. It may then ask for your Mac's login password to approve the export. Enter your own Mac password if it asks.

**Miracle**: "That's it! Please send me that final `Nadiapoint_Distribution.p12` file from your Desktop."

**Wisdom**: Send the final `.p12` file to Miracle.

**Miracle**: "Thank you so much, Wisdom! That's everything I need. You can delete all the files from your Desktop now."
