### iOS Build Signing Fix: Final Steps

This document provides the final instructions to resolve the iOS build signing errors on Bitrise.

---

### Current Status

1.  **Project File Corrected**: The Xcode project (`.pbxproj`) is now correctly configured to use manual signing with the `Apple Distribution` certificate and to look for a provisioning profile named `match AppStore com.nadiapoint.exchange`.

2.  **New Error**: The build is failing with `No profile ... matching 'match AppStore com.nadiapoint.exchange' found`.

3.  **Root Cause**: This error is happening because the required provisioning profile has not been uploaded to your Bitrise project's **Code Signing** section.

### **THE REAL FINAL FIX**: Removing the Build Step Override

After all other fixes, the build still failed because a setting in the Bitrise workflow itself was overriding the project's code signing configuration.

**The Culprit:**

- In the **Workflow Editor**, inside the **Xcode Archive & Export for iOS** step, there is a field called **"Additional options for the xcodebuild command"**.
- This field contained the value `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=J3RMZWZ73D`.
- This was forcing the build to use a specific team ID, which conflicted with our manual signing setup.

**The Solution:**

1.  Go to the **Workflow Editor**.
2.  Click on the **Xcode Archive & Export for iOS** step.
3.  Find the field **Additional options for the xcodebuild command**.
4.  **Delete** the text `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=J3RMZWZ73D` from the box.
5.  **Save** the workflow.

This action stops Bitrise from interfering and allows the manual signing settings in the `project.pbxproj` file to work as intended.

**The Final Piece: Adding the Team ID to the Project**

The last error `Signing for "Runner" requires a development team` indicated that even with manual signing, Xcode needed to know which team the profile belonged to. The final fix was to add the team ID directly into the project file.

- **File**: `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- **Action**: Added `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = J3RMZWZ73D;` to both `Release` build configurations.

This completes the manual signing configuration, telling Xcode exactly which profile to use AND which team it belongs to.

**Step 2: Upload the Profile to Bitrise**

1.  Go to your app on **Bitrise.io**.
2.  Navigate to the **Workflow** tab, then select the **Code Signing** tab.
3.  In the **Provisioning Profiles** section, drag and drop (or use the uploader) to add the `.mobileprovision` file you just downloaded.

**Step 3: Run a New Build**

- Once the profile is uploaded, go back to your app's main page and trigger a new build.

This should resolve the final signing error. Please let me know the result of the next build.

### Previous Incorrect Fixes

If the error persists even after uploading the profile, it is due to a caching issue on the Bitrise build machine. You must clear the cache before the next build.

1.  On your app's main page, find the menu on the left side.
2.  Click on **Build Cache**.
3.  On the Build Cache page, find and click the button to **Delete all caches**.
4.  Once the cache is cleared, go back to the main **Builds** page and start a new build normally.

This will force the build machine to download all your code signing files fresh, resolving the issue.

### Solution Implemented

Since you don't have access to a macOS machine with Xcode, we performed the following actions directly:

1.  **Manually Edited Project File**: I directly edited the `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file.
2.  **Corrected Signing Identity**: I changed the `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` for the `Release` build configuration from `iPhone Developer` to `Apple Distribution`.
3.  **Set Manual Signing Style**: I also set the `CODE_SIGN_STYLE` to `Manual` for the `Release` configuration to ensure it uses the specified certificate.

### Current Status

The necessary changes have been applied to the project file. You should now commit and push these changes, then re-run the Bitrise build.
