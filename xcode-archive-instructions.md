### iOS Build Signing Fix: Final Steps

This document provides the final instructions to resolve the iOS build signing errors on Bitrise.

---

### Current Status

1.  **Project File Corrected**: The Xcode project (`.pbxproj`) is now correctly configured to use manual signing with the `Apple Distribution` certificate and to look for a provisioning profile named `match AppStore com.nadiapoint.exchange`.

2.  **New Error**: The build is failing with `No profile ... matching 'match AppStore com.nadiapoint.exchange' found`.

3.  **Root Cause**: This error is happening because the required provisioning profile has not been uploaded to your Bitrise project's **Code Signing** section.

### **The Correct & Final Configuration**

The root cause of the build failures was a conflict between how the Xcode project file was configured and how the Bitrise workflow was trying to manage code signing. The solution is to make them work together.

#### Part 1: Configure the Xcode Project File

The project file must be set up for **Manual Signing** and point directly to the provisioning profile's UUID. This removes all ambiguity.

-   **File**: `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
-   **Settings for both `Release` configurations**:
    -   `CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Manual;`
    -   `"CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=iphoneos*]" = "Apple Distribution";`
    -   `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER = "14385a45-f676-46d8-af8e-ba68b50ed804";`
    -   **IMPORTANT**: `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` must **NOT** be set in this file.

#### Part 2: Configure the Bitrise Workflow

The Bitrise workflow needs the Team ID to find the correct code signing assets, but it must be provided in the correct field so it doesn't override the project settings.

1.  Go to the **Workflow Editor**.
2.  Click on the **Xcode Archive & Export for iOS** step.
3.  Find the **IPA export configuration** section.
4.  In the **Developer Portal team** field, enter your Team ID: `J3RMZWZ73D`.
5.  Ensure the **Additional options for the xcodebuild command** field (further down) is **empty**.
6.  **Save** the workflow.

This combination ensures that Bitrise can find your signing certificate using your Team ID, and Xcode will then use the exact provisioning profile specified in your project, resolving the conflict.

**Step 2: Upload the Profile to Bitrise**

1.  Go to your app on **Bitrise.io**.
2.  Navigate to the **Workflow** tab, then select the **Code Signing** tab.
3.  In the **Provisioning Profiles** section, drag and drop (or use the uploader) to add the `.mobileprovision` file you just downloaded.

**Step 3: Run a New Build**

- Once the profile is uploaded, go back to your app's main page and trigger a new build.

This should resolve the final signing error. Please let me know the result of the next build.

### Previous Incorrect Fixes

If the error persists even after uploading the profile, it is due to a caching issue on the Bitrise build machine. You must clear the cache before the next build.

1.  On your app's main page, find the menu on the left side.
2.  Click on **Build Cache**.
3.  On the Build Cache page, find and click the button to **Delete all caches**.
4.  Once the cache is cleared, go back to the main **Builds** page and start a new build normally.

This will force the build machine to download all your code signing files fresh, resolving the issue.

### Solution Implemented

Since you don't have access to a macOS machine with Xcode, we performed the following actions directly:

1.  **Manually Edited Project File**: I directly edited the `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file.
2.  **Corrected Signing Identity**: I changed the `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` for the `Release` build configuration from `iPhone Developer` to `Apple Distribution`.
3.  **Set Manual Signing Style**: I also set the `CODE_SIGN_STYLE` to `Manual` for the `Release` configuration to ensure it uses the specified certificate.

### Current Status

The necessary changes have been applied to the project file. You should now commit and push these changes, then re-run the Bitrise build.
