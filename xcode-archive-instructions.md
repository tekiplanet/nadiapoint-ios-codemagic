### iOS Build Signing Fix: Final Steps

This document provides the final instructions to resolve the iOS build signing errors on Bitrise.

---

### Current Status

1.  **Project File Corrected**: The Xcode project (`.pbxproj`) is now correctly configured to use manual signing with the `Apple Distribution` certificate and to look for a provisioning profile named `match AppStore com.nadiapoint.exchange`.

2.  **New Error**: The build is failing with `No profile ... matching 'match AppStore com.nadiapoint.exchange' found`.

3.  **Root Cause**: This error is happening because the required provisioning profile has not been uploaded to your Bitrise project's **Code Signing** section.

### **Final Fix**: Using the Profile UUID

When using the profile *name* still resulted in a "Profile Not Found" error, the final solution was to reference the provisioning profile by its unique ID (UUID) instead.

**Action Taken:**

1.  **Located the UUID**: The UUID for the provisioning profile (`14385a45-f676-46d8-af8e-ba68b50ed804`) was found in the **Code Signing** section of the Bitrise project.

2.  **Updated Project File**: The `project.pbxproj` file was edited to replace the profile name with the UUID for the `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER` setting in both `Release` configurations.

    -   **Old Value**: `"match AppStore com.nadiapoint.exchange"`
    -   **New Value**: `"14385a45-f676-46d8-af8e-ba68b50ed804"`

This provides a direct, unambiguous link to the profile, bypassing any potential name resolution or caching issues.

**Step 2: Upload the Profile to Bitrise**

1.  Go to your app on **Bitrise.io**.
2.  Navigate to the **Workflow** tab, then select the **Code Signing** tab.
3.  In the **Provisioning Profiles** section, drag and drop (or use the uploader) to add the `.mobileprovision` file you just downloaded.

**Step 3: Run a New Build**

- Once the profile is uploaded, go back to your app's main page and trigger a new build.

This should resolve the final signing error. Please let me know the result of the next build.

### Build Caching (Attempted Fix)

If the error persists even after uploading the profile, it is due to a caching issue on the Bitrise build machine. You must clear the cache before the next build.

1.  On your app's main page, find the menu on the left side.
2.  Click on **Build Cache**.
3.  On the Build Cache page, find and click the button to **Delete all caches**.
4.  Once the cache is cleared, go back to the main **Builds** page and start a new build normally.

This will force the build machine to download all your code signing files fresh, resolving the issue.

### Solution Implemented

Since you don't have access to a macOS machine with Xcode, we performed the following actions directly:

1.  **Manually Edited Project File**: I directly edited the `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file.
2.  **Corrected Signing Identity**: I changed the `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` for the `Release` build configuration from `iPhone Developer` to `Apple Distribution`.
3.  **Set Manual Signing Style**: I also set the `CODE_SIGN_STYLE` to `Manual` for the `Release` configuration to ensure it uses the specified certificate.

### Current Status

The necessary changes have been applied to the project file. You should now commit and push these changes, then re-run the Bitrise build.
