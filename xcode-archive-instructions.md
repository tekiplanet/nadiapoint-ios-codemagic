### iOS Build Signing Fix Summary

This file summarizes the steps taken to resolve the Bitrise build signing errors.

---

### Problem Description

The build was failing with a `No profiles for 'com.nadiapoint.exchange' were found` error. This was because the Xcode project was incorrectly configured to use a **Development** signing certificate for **Release** builds, instead of the required **Distribution** certificate.

### Solution Implemented

Since you don't have access to a macOS machine with Xcode, we performed the following actions directly:

1.  **Manually Edited Project File**: I directly edited the `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file.
2.  **Corrected Signing Identity**: I changed the `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` for the `Release` build configuration from `iPhone Developer` to `Apple Distribution`.
3.  **Set Manual Signing Style**: I also set the `CODE_SIGN_STYLE` to `Manual` for the `Release` configuration to ensure it uses the specified certificate.

### Current Status

The necessary changes have been applied to the project file. You should now commit and push these changes, then re-run the Bitrise build.
