Subject: Urgent: Persistent Code Signing Failure - Certificate URL is Corrupted or Empty

App Slug: [PLEASE ADD YOUR APP SLUG HERE]
Latest Failing Build URL: [PLEASE ADD THE URL OF YOUR LAST FAILED BUILD HERE]

Hi Bitrise Support Team,

We are experiencing a persistent and critical code signing failure that is preventing us from building our iOS application. After extensive troubleshooting, we have isolated the root cause to the $BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL environment variable being consistently corrupted or empty, while the $BITRISE_PROVISION_URL works correctly.

Here is a detailed summary of our setup and the exhaustive steps we have taken to resolve this:

SIGNING FILE GENERATION PROCESS

To ensure the integrity of our signing files, we followed a meticulous process:

1. Provisioning Profile (.mobileprovision): Downloaded directly from our Apple Developer account (Apple Distribution type).

2. Certificate (.p12):
   - The official Apple Distribution certificate (.cer) was downloaded from the Apple Developer account.
   - A team member with a macOS machine imported this .cer file into their Keychain Access.
   - They then exported the certificate along with its associated private key to create the .p12 file, providing a password during export.

Both files were then uploaded to the Bitrise Code Signing tab, the password was entered, and the "Exposed" toggle was enabled for both.

TROUBLESHOOTING ATTEMPTS & BUILD FAILURES

We have tried multiple methods to install these files, all of which have failed for the same underlying reason:

Attempt 1: Default 'Certificate and profile installer' Step
- Result: The step failed with an "unsupported protocol scheme" error. This was our first indication that the environment variables were not being populated correctly.

Attempt 2: Custom 'Script' with 'curl'
- Action: We replaced the default step with a custom script to manually download and install the files using curl.
- Debugging: We used 'env | sort' to identify the correct environment variable names: $BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL and $BITRISE_PROVISION_URL.
- Result: The script successfully downloaded the provisioning profile from $BITRISE_PROVISION_URL. However, the curl command for the certificate failed with a "Malformed input to a URL function" error, indicating the $BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL was not a valid URL.

Attempt 3: Using 'File Downloader' Steps
- Action: To rule out any issues with our script, we replaced it with two official 'File Downloader' steps.
- Result: The step for the provisioning profile succeeded. The step for the certificate failed with the error: 'wget: unable to resolve host address ‘empty’'.

CONCLUSION & CORE ISSUE

The final error from the 'File Downloader' step is the definitive proof: the $BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL variable is literally being resolved to the string 'empty'. The provisioning profile URL, handled by the same system, works perfectly every time.

This demonstrates that the issue is not with our workflow configuration, our script, or the .p12 file itself. The problem lies in a platform-level issue on Bitrise's side where the uploaded .p12 file is not generating a valid, accessible URL, or the variable is being explicitly overwritten with an invalid value.

We have also tried deleting and re-uploading the .p12 file to force a new URL to be generated, but the issue persists.

Could you please investigate the backend handling of our uploaded certificate for the app specified above and determine why it is generating a corrupted or empty URL? This issue has completely blocked our CI/CD pipeline.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards.
